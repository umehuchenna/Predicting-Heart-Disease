# Predicting-Heart-Disease
This project was done and submitted to Teeside University Middlesbrough,In Partial Fulfilment of the Requirement for the Course Module: Machine 
Learning. The aim of this Project is to is to predict those who are risk of having a heart attack from different diagnostic variables using the different machine learning models and to draw a comparison on the level of accuracy between these models. The data set used for this study was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression). the contained 3389 observations and 17 features about patients. The data 
comprises of information relating to patients’ demography such as age, education, sex, habits, etc. Different machine learning models was adopted, using classification algorithms to predict which patient is more likely at risk of having a heart disease. In this project the logistics regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour’s, random forest and MLP models was used to predict which patient is more likely at risk of having a heart disease. The models achieved an accuracy of 85%, 84%, 83%, 84%, and 76% respectively. However, the logistics regression gave the highest accuracy of 85% on the target variable, while MLP classifier was observed to have the highest score in the AUC metrics
